# 1. File Creation
echo "Sample text data for linking demonstration" > ~/sample_data.txt
# Explanation: Created original file with sample content. Serves as source for links.

# 2. Hard Link Creation
ln ~/sample_data.txt ~/sample_hard.txt
# Explanation: Created hard link. Both files share the same inode and data blocks.

# 3. Symbolic Link Creation
ln -s ~/sample_data.txt ~/sample_soft.txt
# Explanation: Created symbolic link. This is a pointer to the original file path.

# 4. Inode Verification
ls -i ~/sample_data.txt ~/sample_hard.txt ~/sample_soft.txt
# Explanation: Displayed inode numbers. Shows which files share the same inode.

# 5. Inode Analysis
# Explanation: sample_data.txt and sample_hard.txt share the same inode because hard links are different names for the same data. sample_soft.txt has a different inode as it's a separate file containing a path reference.

# 6. File Metadata Inspection
stat ~/sample_data.txt
# Explanation: Displayed detailed file info including permissions, size, and timestamps.

# 7. Disk Usage Check
du -sh ~
# Explanation: Showed home directory disk usage in human-readable format (MB/GB).

# 8. File Size Overview
ls -lh ~
# Explanation: Displayed sizes of all files in home directory in readable format.

# 9. Link Deletion Test
rm ~/sample_soft.txt
ls -l ~/sample_data.txt
# Explanation: Deleted symbolic link. Original file remains unaffected, confirming soft link nature.

# 10. Disk Utility Demonstration
du -ah ~ | head -10
df -h
# Explanation: du shows disk usage per directory, df shows filesystem usage. Both help monitor storage.
